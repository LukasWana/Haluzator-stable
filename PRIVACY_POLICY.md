# Privacy Policy for Haluzator

**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Introduction

Haluzator ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our Haluzator application ("the App").

## Information We Collect

### Local Data Storage
- **Session Files**: The App stores your visual compositions and project files locally on your device. These files are saved in JSON format and contain only your project settings, media references, and configuration data.
- **Media Files**: Images, videos, and 3D models that you import into the App are stored locally on your device. We do not access or transmit these files.
- **Application Settings**: Your preferences and settings are stored locally on your device.

### Microphone Access
- The App requests microphone access to enable audio-reactive visual effects. Audio data is processed locally in real-time and is **never recorded, stored, or transmitted**. The audio analysis is performed entirely on your device and is used only to generate visual effects that respond to sound.

### Network Access
- **Google Fonts**: The App loads the IBM Plex Sans font from Google Fonts to display text. This may involve transmitting your IP address to Google's servers. Please refer to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for more information.
- **CDN Resources**: The App loads certain JavaScript libraries (React, Three.js, Monaco Editor, WebMIDI) from content delivery networks (CDNs) to function properly. This may involve transmitting your IP address to these CDN providers.
- **Optional AI Features**: If you choose to use AI-powered features, the App may connect to Google Gemini API. This requires you to provide your own API key, which is stored locally on your device. Any data sent to Google Gemini API is subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy). We do not collect or store any data from AI API interactions.

### HTML Overlay Content
- The App allows you to add custom HTML content as overlays. If your HTML content includes external resources (images, scripts, stylesheets), those resources will be loaded from their respective sources. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of external websites or services accessed through HTML overlays.

## How We Use Information

- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs locally on your device. Visual effects, audio analysis, and media rendering are performed entirely on your computer.
- **No Data Transmission**: We do not transmit, upload, or share your project files, media, or any personal data to our servers or third parties.
- **No Analytics**: The App does not include analytics, tracking, or telemetry features.
